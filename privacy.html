      <h1 style="margin-bottom:6px;">Privacy Policy for CarParkWhere?</h1>
      <p class="site-subtle"><em>Effective date: September 26, 2025</em></p>

      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>CarParkWhere?</strong> (“the App”, “we”, “us”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the App.</p>

      <h2>What we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account information</strong><br> Email and basic profile info from your chosen sign‑in method (Email/Password, Sign in with Apple, Google Sign‑In). Managed by Firebase Authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>Location data</strong><br> Car locations you explicitly save (address, timestamp, optional floor/lot/area/pillar, optional photo/thumbnail, and optional coordinates). Optional home carpark geofencing (if enabled) for local reminders. Geofencing runs on-device; we do not continuously upload your live location.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications and device info</strong><br> Push token (FCM), device identifier (IDFV), platform (iOS), and app version to deliver notifications reliably.</li>
        <li><strong>Family sharing</strong><br> Share codes, membership records (your user ID, share ID, joinedAt, access level), and car locations shared with approved family members.</li>
        <li><strong>Photos</strong><br> Optional photos you attach to a car location or a family group image. Stored in Firebase Storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Network and diagnostics</strong><br> Basic logs for reliability (e.g., errors, ad load status). No third‑party analytics SDKs are integrated beyond Firebase components used for core features.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising</strong><br> Google AdMob may collect device and usage information to serve ads. We do not request tracking permission (IDFA). AdMob may use contextual signals and platform settings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How we use your data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide core features: save and retrieve your car locations, enable on-device proximity reminders, and share a saved location with your approved family members.</li>
        <li>Deliver notifications: send you and your family members relevant alerts (e.g., location updates).</li>
        <li>Maintain security and reliability: fraud prevention, troubleshooting, and product improvement.</li>
        <li>Serve ads: display interstitial ads after successful location updates.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data sharing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Family members you approve</strong><br> Family members in your active share can view car locations shared within the group (not continuous background tracking).</li>
        <li><strong>Service providers</strong><br> Google Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions, Cloud Messaging, Storage) and Google AdMob process data on our behalf to deliver the App’s functionality and ads. Apple (MapKit/CLGeocoder) may process coordinates to return human‑readable addresses.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal compliance</strong><br> We may disclose information to comply with law, protect rights, or ensure safety.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your car locations, images, and family memberships are retained until you delete them or request deletion.</li>
        <li>Push tokens and device info are retained while your account is active or until you sign out (sign out removes the stored push token from your user record).</li>
        <li>Logs are retained for a limited period for troubleshooting.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your choices and controls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Location permissions:</strong> grant “When In Use” or “Always” in iOS Settings. “Always” enables background/geofence reminders.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> enable/disable in iOS Settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Family sharing:</strong> generate a share code, join/revoke/leave shares from the App’s family sharing screens.</li>
        <li><strong>Data deletion:</strong> Delete specific car locations and associated images within the app UI (where available). To request account/data deletion, contact support (see Contact Us). We will delete your account data stored in Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage) within a reasonable time.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising choices:</strong> Manage personalized ads using your device settings and Google’s ad settings. We don’t sell personal information.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All traffic is encrypted in transit; Firebase encrypts data at rest.</li>
        <li>Firestore security rules restrict read/write of car locations to the owner and (for reads) members of the same family share.</li>
        <li>Note on images: images stored in Firebase Storage are available to authenticated users of the app; access requires the exact path/URL. Avoid uploading sensitive content.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>International data transfers</h2>
      <p>Data may be processed and stored by Google Cloud/Firebase in data centers across regions. Protections are applied per provider terms and applicable law.</p>

      <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the equivalent age in your jurisdiction). Do not use the App if you are under the minimum age.</p>

      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be posted in the App or on our website.</p>
